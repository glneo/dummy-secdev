This is a dummy version of the secure development package (SECDEV) used to
create secured images for secure TI devices.

This project does *not* actually sign/encrypt images. This is only meant for
development testing when the real SECDEV tools package is not available.

The real tools used to generate boot images for secure devices can be
downloaded from:

	http://www.ti.com/mysecuresoftware (login required)

The secure development package is access controlled due to NDA and export
control restrictions. Access must be requested and granted by TI before the
package is viewable and downloadable. Contact TI, either online or by way
of a local TI representative, to request access.
